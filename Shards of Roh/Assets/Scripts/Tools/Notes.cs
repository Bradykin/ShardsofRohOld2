//Selection Box
	//Idea 1: When selecting units + buildings, select the group that has more objects in the box, not the units
	//Idea 2: Add a toggle that makes selection prioritize buildings over units

//Multi Building Actions
	//Idea 1: All queue object
	//Idea 2: Toggle between all queue and one queue in options, off by default
	//Idea 3: Rotate which one takes the action

//Multi Unit Ability
	//Idea 1: Contextual, based on the cost of ability, immediacy, and whether you would use it multiple times in same spot

//Clicking command group when already selected moves camera to it
