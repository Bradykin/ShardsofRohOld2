//ERRORS

//Generating City around location
	//Generate a set of possible building locations, by choosing random directions from current buildings, at a distance based on the building size, and confirming the building can fit there
	//Find the best point of the list generated (generate 20-50?), based on which is overall closest to the currently existing buildings
	//I should probably have villagers diverted to build things

//Multi Building Actions
	//Idea 1: All queue object
	//Idea 2: Toggle between all queue and one queue in options, off by default
	//Idea 3: Rotate which one takes the action

//Multi Unit Ability
	//Idea 1: Contextual, based on the cost of ability, immediacy, and whether you would use it multiple times in same spot

//I don't remember what this note means but if I delete it I will curse myself
	//Clicking command group when already selected moves camera to it
